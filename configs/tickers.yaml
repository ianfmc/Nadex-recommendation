# DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
# This file has been replaced by ticker_mappings.yaml
# 
# All ticker configuration is now managed in ticker_mappings.yaml as a single source of truth.
# That file contains:
# - All ticker symbols with metadata (display_name, description, asset_class)
# - Active/inactive flags to control which tickers are actively traded
# - Test tickers list
#
# To enable/disable a ticker for trading, edit ticker_mappings.yaml and change the 'active' flag.
#
# This file is kept only for reference and will be removed in a future sprint.
